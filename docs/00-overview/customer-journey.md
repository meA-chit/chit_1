# Core Customer Journey

The pilot journey moves from understanding and trusting Chit to using it daily and extracting explainable insights.

## Measurement intent

- Discovery: household can explain the proposition, compatibility and privacy model.
- First login: administrator connects minimum sources and publishes a screen-safe view.
- Daily usage: members identify plans, chores, availability and data-quality issues at a glance.
- Insight extraction: users understand why an item appeared and decide what to do without assuming Chit acted.

## Journeys still to define (module expansion)
The journey above covers the pilot household overview. Not yet mapped: couple finance setup and monthly settle-up; parent configures a child's mobile view; child's daily use (school plan, reminders, chores and stars); partner/member onboarding with per-person privacy. Add these as module-level journeys under `docs/modules/<module>/` when their stories are written.
